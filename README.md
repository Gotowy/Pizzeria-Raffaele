# pizzeria-raffaele

This is the second version of Pizzeria Raffaele (my first personal project) re-built with React and styled components. The main purpose was to design and build from scratch a simple and responsive web application which could simulate a page of some actual restaurant.

## Built with:

HTML i CSS (flex-box, grid, media queries)<br/>
JavaScript<br/>
React (Hooks, React-Router-DOM"<br/>
Styled Components <br />
Google fonts<br/>
Font awesome<br/>

## Functionality:

The most significant content on the page is pizza menu divided into rolled categories. There are subpages with information required to place an order. Subpages can be switched thanks to navigation menu which is rolled or static depending on viewport width.

## Status:

For now the project is completed but I am going to add some animations created in Framer Motion in the future.
